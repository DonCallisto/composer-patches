# Commands

Installing the plugin will introduce a new composer command group: **patch**

```shell
# Apply new patches (similar to patch apply on 'composer install') 
composer patch:apply

# Apply new patches and continue even if some of them fail
composer patch:apply --graceful

# Re-apply all patches
composer patch:redo 

# Re-apply all patches and ignore any local repository changes on packages
composer patch:redo --force

# Re-apply patches for one speicif package
# (Keeps the patches that were not matched, applied)
composer patch:redo my/package 

# Re-apply all patches except patches declared against my/package
# (Keeps the patches that were not matched, applied)
composer patch:redo '!my/package'

# Re-apply patches for one specific package with patch name filter 
# (Keeps the patches that were not matched, applied)
composer patch:redo --filter wrong-time-format --filter other-file 

# Re-apply patches and skip filenames that contain 'some<anything>description'  
# (Keeps the patches that were not matched, applied)
composer patch:redo --filter '!some*description' my/package 

# Reset all patched packages
composer patch:undo 

# Reset patches for specified packages (path:apply will restore them)
composer patch:undo my/package other/package

# Reset one specific patch on package
composer patch:undo --filter some-fix my/package

# Reset packages that have patch that contains 'some-fix' in it's path definition
composer patch:undo --filter some-fix

# Gather patches information from /vendor instead of install.json and apply
composer patch:apply --from-source

# Ideal for testing out a newly added patch against my/package
composer patch:redo --from-source

# Check that all patches have valid target package info (using info from vendor)
composer patch:validate --from-source

# Check that patches that are owner by ROOT package are all defined correctly
composer patch:validate --local

# List registered with their current status (with optional filter(s))
composer patch:list --status new --status removed

# List all patches that have either changed, are new or got removed 
composer patch:list --status '!applied'
```

Note that `--from-source` is only needed when patch target definitions are provided within a 
**composer.json** file. If patches Provided in a separate file, the only reason to use this flag
is when `patches-file` definitions have changed.

The main purpose of this command is to make the maintenance of already created patches and adding new 
ones as easy as possible by allowing user to test out a patch directly right after defining it without 
having to trigger `composer update` or `composer install`.

Note that 'validate' command will also validate patches with constraints or with #skip flag in their
path (or in embedded data).
